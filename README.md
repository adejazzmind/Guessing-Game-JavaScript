A guessing game in JavaScript is an interactive program where the computer generates a secret value (most commonly a number or a word), and the user attempts to guess that value within a certain number of attempts. The game provides feedback to the user after each guess, indicating whether their guess was too high, too low, or incorrect in the case of a word game, guiding them towards the correct answer.
